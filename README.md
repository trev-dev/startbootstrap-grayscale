## Usage

After installation, run `npm install` and then run `gulp` to build the initial build folder, then `gulp dev` to start the watchers. Use PHP (v7+) to start a server in the build folder with `php -S localhost:<port>`. Reload your browser to see changes.

#### Gulp Tasks

- `gulp` the default task that builds everything
- `gulp dev` browserSync opens the project in your default browser and live reloads when changes are made
- `gulp css` compiles SCSS files into CSS and minifies the compiled CSS
- `gulp js` minifies the themes JS file
- `gulp vendor` copies dependencies from node_modules to the vendor directory

You must have npm and Gulp installed globally on your machine in order to use these features.
